Things yet to be done in this application
=========================================

  - [ ] Unify convention. Technically, to follow AOSP convention we should be doing Hungarian
        notation, but we have a mix of things here.
  - [ ] The audio player needs to start itself in the foreground
  - [ ] The notification needs to spawn from the service
  - [ ] The notification needs to have actions wired to it
  - [ ] The "Shows" fragment needs to be created and injected into the nav drawer callbacks
  - [ ] The stations list needs to fetch now playing info
  - [ ] The bottom drawer needs to show and hide itself as playback starts and stops
  - [ ] Video playback, full stop.
  - [ ] Clean up and fix the Javadocs. Ideally, the full project will be documented enough that 
        anyone can hop in and use the project
  - [ ] Remove dead callback classes, we don't need stupid noops in the code.
